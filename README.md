# C-Frogger
A very simple clone of the classic arcade game, Frogger. Made in Java, using LibGDX.

This project is very simplistic and was done largely to get a good grip of LibGDX's basic features. As such, the code is not well-optimized or perfectly ordered. I do plan on revisiting this project and making it less messy.

C-Frogger contains only the core gameplay mechanics of the standard arcade game, except for the fly and the bonus frog that spawns in the logs.
